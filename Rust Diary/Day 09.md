# Day 9
## Level 0
Build a single file:

```
rustc src/Main.rs
```

Problems to get `rustc` to run with `tup`, it seems to write a lot of temporary data outside of the source. Tons of build residues, not nice.

Using another build system is not fun with Rust, which is bad. Don't force your tools onto me.
