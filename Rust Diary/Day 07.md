# Day 7
Pattern matching on boxes is an unstable feature, so I need a nightly build. This works surprisingly well with rustup.

There's a difference between casting with `from()` and with `as`.

It is not the compiler's job to enforce coding standards; I should be allowed to use any identifier I like.
