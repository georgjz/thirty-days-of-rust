# Thirty Days of Rust, ~~Second~~ Third Attempt

Repository documenting my third experience with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org). Use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) (or just any text editor) to read my diary notes in the `Rust Diary` directory.

For my third attempt, I decided to invest in a copy of Tim McNamara's [Rust in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/rust-in-action), as I found the Rust intro book very frustrating to follow.

This is work in progress. A final recap will be [on my blog](https://georgjz.github.io).
