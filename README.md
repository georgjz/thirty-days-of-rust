# Thirty Days of Rust

Repository documenting my experience with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org). Use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) (or just any text editor) to read my diary notes in the `Rust Diary` directory.

This is work in progress. A final recap will be [on my blog](https://georgjz.github.io).
